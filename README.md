MC_Mandrill
===========

1.**What is it?**

A (very) small Magento extension for using Mandrill for transactional emails. Rewrites *Mage_Core_Model_Email_Template*.

2.**Usage**

Install the extension...Just copy and paste the files into your Magento root directory. Modman will be available some time in the future...I hope.

Then, sign up to [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com/). Go to Settings and generate an API key.
Copy the information from Mandrill for Host, Port, SMTP Username, and SMTP Password into your Magento installation in *System> Configuration > System > Mail Sending Settings*.
